# f1-race-strategy

Timeline: Complete by the US Grand Prix in October 2024 so that we can implement it for the US Grand Prix

Purpose: Be able to use practice run plans to simulate the best tire strategy for the race.

Subgoal: Compare our strategy against that of teams to determine how closely our strategy follows theirs and, if it differs, which ended up performing better.
